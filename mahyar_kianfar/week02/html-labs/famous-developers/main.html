  <div class="box b"><h4>Biography</h4><p>Herbert Marshall McLuhan CC (July 21, 1911 â€“ December 31, 1980) was a Canadian philosopher. His work is one of the cornerstones of the study of media theory.Born in Edmonton, Alberta, McLuhan studied at the University of Manitoba and the University of Cambridge. He began his teaching career as a professor of English at several universities in the U.S. and Canada before moving to the University of Toronto in 1946, where he remained for the rest of his life.

McLuhan coined the expression "the medium is the message" and the term global village, and predicted the World Wide Web almost 30 years before it was invented.He was a fixture in media discourse in the late 1960s, though his influence began to wane in the early 1970s.In the years after his death, he continued to be a controversial figure in academic circles.With the arrival of the Internet and the World Wide Web, interest was renewed in his work and perspective.</p></div>
