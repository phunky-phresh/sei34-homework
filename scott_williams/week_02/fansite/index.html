        <h3>Who is Sophie Wilson?</h3>
        <p>Sophie Mary Wilson, born 1957, is an English computer scientist. The processor that she designed, the ARM, has become one of the most popular IP cores (or chips) in the world. IP cores are the building blocks within integrated circuits.
          </p>
          <p>ARM stands for Advanced Reduced instruction set computing Machine. The ARM is so successful because it was one of the very first low power microprocessors.</p>
          <p>It is claimed that Sophie's ARM processor is found in over 35 billion devices, including modern mobile phones and digital cameras.</p>

        <h3>Why Joel admires Sophie</h3>
        <p>Sophie Wilson invented the 'ARM' microprocessor. </p>
        <p>Joel admires Sophie because she is an understated computer programmer who has made a real difference to microprocessors yet does not feel the need to learn CSS. Her personal website is a brilliant example of what something can look like when you don't want to learn CSS.</p>

        <h3>Something Joel does not know about Sophie</h3>
        <p>Sophie believes that hardware is no longer what is holding back processor speed. Since 2006, the lack of speed in computation ability is due to scalar programming languages (C, Ruby, Javascript) that are a poor fit for parallel hardware. Sophie believes we should all start programming in OpenCL to take advantage of parallel hardware.
        </p>
        <p>Also, her last holiday photo update on her personal site was her two week driving holiday to Arizona in 2014. I bet nobody knew that Sophie thought Arizona was a hoot!</p>
