      <h2>BIO</h2>
      <p>Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace's father was Lord Byron, the notoriously mad, bad, and ~dangerous to know~ club footed oft considered genius Romantic poet. He abandoned his family when Ada was 2 months old.</p>
      <p>Her mother, Annabella Byron, was concerned Ada would inherit her fatherâ€™s creative albeit moral and emotional excesses, so she nurtured her in science and mathematical skills.</p>
      <p>At age 18, at her society debut at the royal court she met 44-year old renowned mathematician Charles Babbage (co-founder of the Royal Astronomical Society). Highly impressed with her intellect and her deep understanding and exertion of the sciences, they corresponded and collaborated throughout her short life.</p>
      <p>Babbage had invented the Difference Engine, a machine that was meant to carry out mathematical calculations. Lovelace wrote a 20,000 word series of notes intended to enhance the understanding of the machine, which ended up laying the foundations for modern computing.</p>
      <p>So while Babbage invented the engine, it was Lovelace who saw its potential as more than just a calculator, and created a whole field of science in itself, and thus was born computer science and programming. </p>
      <p>i.e. she conceptually and tangibly invented computer programming and the science of computing.</p>
      <p> Her husband was supportive of her mathetmatical passions which was basically unheard of at that point in history and now that we think about it most of history, and she died happy but not very healthy at the age of 35.</p>
