      <h2>TRIVIA</h2>
      <p>One of her tutors, the English mathematician Augustus de Morgan, warned her mother that Lovelace’s capacity for scientific thinking could effect her health: “The very great tension of mind which [mathematics] requires is beyond the strength of a woman’s physical power and application.”</p>
      <p> She journaled after observing Babbage's machine, “The sciences of operations, as derived from mathematics mores especially, is a science of itself, and has its own abstract truth and value” - which is the first description of the science of computing.</p>
      <p>Her "Notes" languished in obscurity before the book was re-published as part of English scientist B V Bowden’s 1953 book "Faster Than Thought: A Symposium on Digital Computing Machines". The onset of “electronic brains,” according to Bowden, had more in common with Lovelace’s genius foresight than with Babbage’s mechanical Engine. </p>
      <p>The “vast and powerful language” she predicted is now the programming languate called ADA which powers underground trains, Boeing777s, satellites, and rockets. </p>
