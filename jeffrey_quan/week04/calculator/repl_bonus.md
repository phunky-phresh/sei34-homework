# Bonus Challenge

## Do-It-Yourself Ruby REPL

Try to create your own Ruby REPL (Read Evaluate Print Loop) program.

It should show a prompt, read some Ruby code from the user, `eval`uate their code, print the result and loop back to the start.

### Sample Session

```
$ ruby repl.rb
Welcome to Ruby REPL
> 2 + 7
9
> "some" + "string"
"somestring"
>
```
